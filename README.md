# React Routing with React Router

This is a simple demo app for React Router, following [Dev Ed's tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls). It uses BrowserRouter, Switch, Route and Link to provide static and dynamic routes, fetching JSON and images from [FortniteAPI](https://docs.fortniteapi.com/?version=latest). You will get URLs like 
* http://localhost:3000/
* http://localhost:3000/about
* http://localhost:3000/shop/ae442d0-a3b40b1-63c984d-e36623f

I made some minor modifications compared to the original tutorial. 

Thanks for Ed, It helped me a lot. 


_Further plans: I would like to apply the same app with typescript, which is clearly the future of such apps_
